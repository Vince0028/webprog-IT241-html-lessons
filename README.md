# This is my resume, Welcome and i hope you enjoy and find it unique and interesting 

-I made 2 perspective for this resume since many types of people have different types of taste in terms of UI or UX. 
And instead of just going for a 1 themed resume why don't i just combine those perspectives or make it a choice? 
that's what i asked myself and did it. and for the future the terminal resume


# Simple Resume
-This version targets employers. Many prefer fast access to information with no clicks or hidden sections. Everything stays visible and direct.


# UI Resume
-This version targets people who like design and structure. It uses a left and right sidebar with a center panel. Making it responsive took effort. It also includes an AI chatbot version of me.


I hope you enjoy the experience and find something that fits your taste.
